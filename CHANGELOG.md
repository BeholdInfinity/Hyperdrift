## [0.1.5] — 2026-07-10

### Added
- Title screen: live fullscreen starfield + nebula with slow camera drift; launch continues from that view
- Title-screen build stamp (bottom-left): version + last-edit datetime from `/build-info.json`
- `src/version.js` — prototype version source of truth
- Local `dev-server.py` (used by `start-game.bat`) with no-cache headers and build-info endpoint
- `VISION.md` — long-term *Hyperdrift Crewline* design
- `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md` — unresolved design decisions

### Changed
- Starfield: 7 denser parallax layers; screen-fixed star size (no zoom swell); brief blink twinkle
- Speed streaks: subtler screen-space particles that fill the viewport at any zoom
- Title UI + backdrop fade in together; light vignette so backdrop matches in-game vibrancy
- Chunk load/unload radii 3 / 5
- `VISION.md` revised with author's original intent (fluid stations, carry chains, scoop vs grapple)

### Fixed
- Starfield hard edge at max zoom-out (tile repeats fill the view)
- Nebula edge color pop-in (ambient generation margin covers full glow before enter)

## [0.1.1] — 2026-07-09

### Changed
- Project renamed from **Space Drift** to **Hyperdrift**
- Added `PROJECT.md`, `GDD.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and Cursor rules for session handoff

### Fixed
- Removed pointer lock; mouse cursor always visible
- WASD thruster mapping and visuals aligned (aft/nose/port/starboard)
- RCS rotation thruster pairs now visible when turning
- Speed streaks move consistently opposite velocity vector
- Pause overlay no longer trapped inside hidden start-screen overlay

### Added
- Mouse wheel zoom with speed-based dynamic zoom-out
- Fullscreen button in Systems panel and pause menu
- ESC pause menu (resume, fullscreen, placeholder settings/main menu)
- Five-layer starfield and three-layer nebula depth
- Procedural ambient nebulae for sparse regions
- HUD zoom readout
