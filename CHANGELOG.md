---

## [0.1.41] — 2026-07-11

### Fixed
- Mechanic blast-wall pathing: route via nearest inter-bay corridor (not job `bay` pad), sticky near→far→hold chain, same-side lateral dodge — stops wrong-wall marches and end-to-end ping-pong

---

## [0.1.40] — 2026-07-11

### Fixed
- Mechanic blast-wall pathing: sticky near→far bypass chain so mid-crossing Y flips no longer pull crew back into the wall

---

## [0.1.39] — 2026-07-11

### Fixed
- Danger-zone lanes narrowed (half-width 72) so neighboring bay verticals no longer overlap; thinner strip strokes
- Mechanic pathing around blast walls: stable bypass side, eject if embedded in wall slab, segment-cross detection

---

## [0.1.38] — 2026-07-11

### Fixed
- Hangar blast backsplash is solid (no center gap); crew path around wall ends
- Stairs moved further south; danger-zone light lanes widened clear of cargo hardpoints

---

## [0.1.37] — 2026-07-11

### Changed
- Hangar stairs moved south of per-bay blast backsplash walls (crew walk around wall ends)
- Per-bay black/yellow danger-zone floor lights (door → former stair line + horizontal closer); yellow cells light on danger; `incoming` / `departing` chase flows on verticals; B2 auto-`danger` when player engines/thrusters fire

---

## [0.1.36] — 2026-07-11

### Changed
- Hangar bay visual pass: industrial walls/floor (panels, rivets, grime, oil stains), caution markings, fuel tanks/hoses, tool stations, barrels, drains, per-bay door warning beacons (`idle` / `warning` / `open`)
- Removed hangar overhead bay lights (floating washes and runway fixtures)

---

## [0.1.35] — 2026-07-11

### Fixed
- Hangar bay windows share one continuous space backdrop (three peeks into the same chunk, not three identical copies)

---

## [0.1.34] — 2026-07-11

### Changed
- Forklifts prioritize outbound takeOut over inbound bringIn (anti-clog)
- Empty forklifts leaving the bay peel off to grab outbound cargo instead of driving past it

---

## [0.1.33] — 2026-07-11

### Fixed
- Mechanics no longer walk up from stairs toward the ship only to turn around and despawn
- Idle crew are not spawned onto the deck; welders only appear when chosen deliberately
- Load/install jobs re-validate before walking to the hull (no empty-handed ship touch)

---

## [0.1.32] — 2026-07-11

### Fixed
- Forklifts no longer spawn cargo mid-bay after a drop — they exit to fetch the next inbound load
- Install / uninstall ship mounts play continuous weld sparks like hull repairs
- Station crew claim tasks (job+pile); claimed work is filtered out of other crew pick lists

---

## [0.1.31] — 2026-07-11

### Fixed
- Idle crew walking to despawn will reroute if new doable work appears
- Mechanics no longer strip ship mounts without a staged replacement (UP·IN); unload only when bay is exporting
- Forklifts no longer flood empty bays with inbound freight (per-bay inbound soft cap)
- Crane hard-prioritizes clearing blocked destinations, then at-capacity piles

---

## [0.1.30] — 2026-07-11

### Changed
- Hold cargo draws as rectangles only; ship-mount upgrades keep complex silhouettes
- Cargo hardpoints use a 2×2 slot grid (horizontal + vertical), max 4 items per area
- Crane / mechanics / forklifts skip full destinations and pick the next doable task
- If only blocked tasks remain, actors linger at the task start until the blockage clears
- Clearing full piles is prioritized for whoever can help (forklifts: south row only)
- With no doable or blocked work left, NPCs path to despawn

---

## [0.1.29] — 2026-07-11

### Changed
- Hangar cargo hardpoints are now **3×6** (two columns per bay: left=inbound, right=outbound)
- Rows: north=ship upgrades, mid=hold cargo, south=forklift ↔ storage I/O
- Crane / forklift / mechanic jobs follow in/out lanes (forklift south-in / south-out only)
- Mechanics also install/remove upgrades (top-row pipeline) alongside mid-row cargo trips
- Stair hatches are one per bay (between that bay’s columns)
- Ship-mount upgrades draw as distinct parts (laser, turret, armor, thruster, engine, sensor), not crates
- Hold cargo silhouettes expanded (ore, ammo crates, barrels, etc.)

### Changed (docs)
- Hangar bay reframed as **Home Base**: seed for new-game start and between-mission hub (extraction / rogue-lite). Bay exists today via title → VIEW SHIP; launch/return loop not wired yet (see `GDD.md`)
- Home Base design note: B1/B3 bay work stays ambient sim; **B2** load/unload/repair/upgrade only runs when the player requests it, with a queue that completes per finished animation (`GDD.md`)

---

## [0.1.28] — 2026-07-11

### Changed
- Hangar default zoom is **9.0** (closer hull inspection on entry)
- Hangar draw order: deck → crew → ships → crane (hulls occlude pedestrians; gantry stays overhead)
- Hangar mechanics enter/exit via stair hatches only (bulkhead doors stay forklift-only)
- Crane claw opens when empty, partially closes around cargo, and opens on drop; carried boxes hang at the fingertips
- Crane trolley has a manned cabin (operator + travel/hoist/grip levers) — no automation fiction

---

## [0.1.27] — 2026-07-11

### Fixed
- Hangar mechanics no longer vanish after reaching cargo: hull approach used `pad.y` on dock targets that had no `y`, producing NaN positions (looked like a despawn; also blocked respawns because “ghost” mechs still counted)
- Hangar mechanics no longer teleport after ship work: pad keep-out is a soft push instead of a hard snap onto the apron
- Hangar mechanics no longer jam south of stair hatches when exiting (approach↔stair waypoint band oscillated in place)
- Hangar spawn prefers a floor of 2 pedestrians before forklifts (cargo pressure was starving mechanic respawns)
- Mechanic flee no longer arms stair exit (avoids popping out on the hatch after a hazard retreat)

---

## [0.1.26] — 2026-07-11

### Fixed
- Hangar mechanics no longer despawn at stair tops or on failed box jobs (clear hatch before work; weld fallback instead of instant exit)

---

## [0.1.25] — 2026-07-11

### Fixed
- Hangar mechanics no longer despawn when fleeing thruster/weapon hazard (retreat and resume)

### Changed
- Crane bridge and trolley drawn smaller; trolley parks farther north of cargo piles

---

## [0.1.24] — 2026-07-11

### Changed
- Hangar mechanics walk straight up to the ship hull (aft for cargo; hull stations for weld)
- Crane trolley parks north of cargo; hoist drops the hook onto the pile
- New mechanic job: empty-handed hull welding with torch sparks

---

## [0.1.23] — 2026-07-11

### Changed
- Hangar mechanics walk pile ↔ assigned ship without pad keep-out twitch; multi-trip load/unload loops
- Four under-deck stair hatches (one per cargo column) between mid and south rows — primary human entry/exit
- Overhead crane rebuilt as runway + bridge + trolley + hoist with full-deck 2D travel

---

## [0.1.22] — 2026-07-11

### Changed
- Hangar cargo is real objects on a 3×4 hardpoint grid; crane/forklift/mechanic transfers move boxes between piles
- Crane + forklifts share the south row; mechanics load/unload mid-row piles ↔ docked ships
- Forklifts enter/leave via L/R interior bulkhead doors (bring-in or take-out by bay inventory pressure)
- Humans only use those doors; bulkheads occlude them except through the open doorway
- Cargo boxes are destructible by turret and mining laser

---

## [0.1.21] — 2026-07-11

### Changed
- Hangar View Ship is full-frame (no circular play clip); flight mode keeps the circle
- Hangar weapon aim works across the whole canvas

---

## [0.1.20] — 2026-07-11

### Changed
- Hangar viewports widened to match bay-door width; live title-space chunk drawn into each glass (fixes black windows)
- Crate stacks: up to 5 random slots (far sides + between-pad lanes); crane picks random pickup/dropoff piles each job

---

## [0.1.19] — 2026-07-11

### Changed
- Hangar bay doors closed by default; title-space peeks through small bordered viewports above each door
- Bay order **B1 · B2 · B3** (left→right); player docks on **B2** (center); visitors on B1/B3
- Overhead gantry crane ferries crates between left/right piles (travel, lower, grab, raise, cross, drop)

---

## [0.1.18] — 2026-07-11

### Changed
- Hangar bay doors show the live title-screen starfield/nebula chunk (same drifting space, no extra load)
- Three bay doors aligned with pads B2 / B1 / B3; side pads shifted outward to match
- Overhead gantry crane: short cable with claw (no longer hangs through pads)
- Visitor ships now have thruster cups + orange engine bells; combat/patrol/scout types carry visible weapons

---

## [0.1.17] — 2026-07-11

### Changed
- Player ship spawns facing **north** (screen-up) in flight and hangar
- Hangar dock pads simplified to flat matte discs (no clamp chevrons) so hull reads clear of the pad
- Hangar oriented with a **bay door to space** north of the player pad; zoom-out shows left/right neighbor pads
- Hangar default zoom widened so door + neighbor pads are visible on entry

### Added
- Neighbor hangar pads randomly empty or occupied by placeholder visitor ships (scout, interceptor, patrol, gunship, freighter, tanker, hauler)

---

## [0.1.16] — 2026-07-11

### Added
- Temporary **View Ship** hangar from the title screen: docked inspection bay with live thrusters, engine, yaw, turret, and mining laser (ship translation locked)
- Hangar backdrop (deck plates, clamps, crates, windows, overhead crane/lights) plus mechanics and forklifts that flinch/flee when thrusters, engine, or weapons fire
- Hangar scroll zoom range (~2.6 ceiling → ~14 hull-fill); ESC or Back returns to title

---

## [0.1.15] — 2026-07-11

### Added
- Dorsal 360° combat turret at hull center (mouse aim, LMB, 3 shots/sec, recoil + muzzle bloom)
- Nose mining laser with limited forward arc (RMB continuous beam)
- Q/E keyboard yaw; double-tap-hold burst on QWEASD
- Caps Lock Precision mode: speed-gated engage, standby when too fast, no afterburner, main-engine warm-up
- Weapon aim/fire only while pointer is inside the play circle (turret gyro vs laser hull-relative lock)

### Changed
- Mouse no longer rotates the ship; flight and combat controls separated
- Controls hint + HUD Precision / Standby readout
- Yaw rates slowed (cruise + fast); translation unchanged
- Turret and mining laser **slew** toward the pointer (no snap on viewport re-entry)
- While Precision is active, engage speed is a **velocity cap** (not a drop-to-standby threshold)

### Fixed
- Ctrl+QWEASD (and Ctrl+Space) no longer trigger browser chords during play (e.g. Ctrl+E search, Ctrl+W close tab)

### Changed
- Space brakes rebound from **Ctrl** to **Alt** (Ctrl+W cannot be blocked in Chromium; Alt is safer with WASD)

---

## [0.1.14] — 2026-07-10

### Changed
- Leading-side flatten retuned: mild velocity **cue** on cones for motion readability; stronger **spray wash** on particles to stop under-hull streaming (not treated as vacuum hull impingement)
- Wash curve tracks angle of attack more clearly (glancing into-flow / edge-of-retro milder than head-on)
- Plume **crosswind lean** on all nozzles (relative wind `−velocity`); trailing plumes slightly longer; cones use a soft curve tip — flames read both AoA and speed

---

## [0.1.13] — 2026-07-10

### Changed
- Thruster and engine plumes ~50% larger (cones and exhaust particles)
- Handoff docs (`PROJECT.md`, `GDD.md`, Cursor rules) synced to hardpoint ship, ship-local exhaust, and post-physics camera tracking

---

## [0.1.12] — 2026-07-10

### Fixed
- Camera now tracks post-physics ship pose so ship-local exhaust no longer appears ahead of the hull at high speed (was using a one-frame-stale position under camera lead)

### Changed
- Ship silhouette: wider aft engineering bay / sponsons for clearer fore–aft read

---

## [0.1.11] — 2026-07-10

### Changed
- Ship silhouette: filled multi-section hull (bridge, body, engineering) with visible thruster cups, engine bell, and nose gun
- Single `HARDPOINTS` table drives gun, main engine/afterburner, and all 8 thruster plume origins

---

## [0.1.10] — 2026-07-10

### Fixed
- Exhaust particles are ship-local (move/rotate with the hull) so high-speed turns no longer leave long world-space “tentacle” trails

---

## [0.1.9] — 2026-07-10

### Changed
- Thruster visuals: 8 blue maneuvering thrusters (face pairs for translation; 4-thruster yaw couples with opposite-group stop burst)
- Main engine / afterburner / retro-burn: orange family; afterburner longer, brighter, slightly narrower
- Leading-side plume flatten so exhaust into velocity stays on that hull face instead of streaming under the ship

---

## [0.1.8] — 2026-07-10

### Fixed
- Space brakes: main-engine retro-burn only when nose faces into velocity (was inverted); nose/aft maneuver brake thrusters match force direction

---

## [0.1.7] — 2026-07-10

### Fixed
- Strafe thruster plumes (A/D and brake laterals) drawn on the correct hull side — port/starboard were visually swapped

---

## [0.1.6] — 2026-07-10

### Fixed
- Space brakes now fully stop the ship instead of coasting forever just under the velocity threshold (HUD stuck around SPD 4 with POS still drifting)

---

## [0.1.5] — 2026-07-10

### Added
- Title screen: live fullscreen starfield + nebula with slow camera drift; launch continues from that view
- Title-screen build stamp (bottom-left): version + last-edit datetime from `/build-info.json`
- `src/version.js` — prototype version source of truth
- Local `dev-server.py` (used by `start-game.bat`) with no-cache headers and build-info endpoint
- `VISION.md` — long-term *Hyperdrift Crewline* design
- `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md` — unresolved design decisions

### Changed
- Starfield: 7 denser parallax layers; screen-fixed star size (no zoom swell); brief blink twinkle
- Speed streaks: subtler screen-space particles that fill the viewport at any zoom
- Title UI + backdrop fade in together; light vignette so backdrop matches in-game vibrancy
- Chunk load/unload radii 3 / 5
- `VISION.md` revised with author's original intent (fluid stations, carry chains, scoop vs grapple)

### Fixed
- Starfield hard edge at max zoom-out (tile repeats fill the view)
- Nebula edge color pop-in (ambient generation margin covers full glow before enter)

---

## [0.1.1] — 2026-07-09

### Changed
- Project renamed from **Space Drift** to **Hyperdrift**
- Added `PROJECT.md`, `GDD.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and Cursor rules for session handoff

### Fixed
- Removed pointer lock; mouse cursor always visible
- WASD thruster mapping and visuals aligned (aft/nose/port/starboard)
- RCS rotation thruster pairs now visible when turning
- Speed streaks move consistently opposite velocity vector
- Pause overlay no longer trapped inside hidden start-screen overlay

### Added
- Mouse wheel zoom with speed-based dynamic zoom-out
- Fullscreen button in Systems panel and pause menu
- ESC pause menu (resume, fullscreen, placeholder settings/main menu)
- Five-layer starfield and three-layer nebula depth
- Procedural ambient nebulae for sparse regions
- HUD zoom readout

---

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-09

### Added
- Initial prototype: semi-Newtonian top-down spaceflight
- WASD maneuvering, main engine, afterburner, smart brakes
- Mouse aim and energy cannon
- Circular viewport with corner UI placeholders
- Procedural chunk-based universe (asteroids, nebulae)
- Parallax starfield, nebula clouds, speed streaks
- Modular architecture: GameEngine, systems, entities, world modules
